# Mission to Mars
## My Journey to NASA
Because of my interest in working at NASA in the future, I developed a website that pulls in various information about Mars as both a resource and a showcase. With the "Scrape New Data" button, up-to-date information will be pulled for the top Mars-related headline of the day, most recent featured image, a standard comparison table versus Earth, and full resolution images showing its four hemispheres. 

I have a lot more research on Mars and further space exploration interest, but this is a preview of my interests and capabilities!
